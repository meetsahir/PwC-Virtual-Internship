# PwC Virtual Intership

I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively.
I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics

As a part of this project, I was working on creating three dashboards for three different problems. It was an incredible journey and learnt a lot on how real life projects are completed

# Task 1 - Call Center Trends

## Problem Statement

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

-  Overall customer satisfaction
-  Overall calls answered/abandoned
-  Calls by time
-  Average speed of answer
-  Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

# Task 2 -  Customer retention

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

-  Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
-  The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources

- Define proper KPIs
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
-  Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

# Task 3 - Diversity and inclusion

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help

Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges

Here are some of the KPIs that can be considered
- number of men
- number of women
- number of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women
